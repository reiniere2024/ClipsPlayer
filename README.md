Hi All,

The Music Clips Player is a little program that I have written to play
my POP&Rock Video Clips. I have collected them for quite some time and
some of the clips are real gems.

If you are also collecting Music clips or wanting to start with it then
you can download this tool for free. I have included some very rare and
difficult to find clips and the rest you will have to find from internet
or from old Music DVD's and video's.

If youre not satisfied with the windows media player then you can also use 
the smaller stable video players vlc, smplayer or media player classic.
(You must include them yourself in maps VLC,SMPlayer and MPC from code
because they are not added here in github)

The program starts with all Clips in the Clips-subdirectory from the map
where you unzip the program. You can select another map/drive if you wish.

Please note:
Music Clip Names must not contain spaces. If they do then they will not be
recognized by the media players!

Good luck,
Reiniere.
